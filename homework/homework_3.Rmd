\subsection*{GitHub (100 points)}
In this section, you will reinforce the concepts and skills covered in the introductory lecture on Git and GitHub. You will answer a set of conceptual questions to demonstrate your understanding of Git’s core functionality and complete hands-on tasks to practice using Git commands and interacting with GitHub.
\begin{enumerate}

  \item What is the purpose of Git, and how does it differ from GitHub?
  \item Explain the difference between a commit and a push in Git.
  \item What does the command git clone do, and how is it different from git pull?
  \item Initialize a new Git repository in a local folder and create a file named README.md. Add some text to it, commit the changes, and push it to a new GitHub repository. Submit the link to your repository.
		\item Fork the \href{https://github.com/wevanjohnson/my.package}{https://github.com/wevanjohnson/my.package} directory and clone it to your local machine. Then add your name as an author in the DESCRIPTION file local repository and add a multiplication function to the R package (R folder). Then push the changes to your GitHub fork, and send me a pull request with your changes.  
		\item Clone the \href{https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2026\_Spring\_FDS}{https://github.com/wevanjohnson/2026\_Spring\_FDS} repository on your computer. Find something that could be improved (typo? explain somthing better), add files/changes to it, and upload it to GitHub. Send another well-annotated pull request to Dr. Johnson.
